Hello there! My name is Gil Keidar. I'm am an undergraduate student studying towards a BS in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. So far, it's a lot of fun!

In this page, I'll post some of my work. You can find a list of my current projects below, and I go a bit more in-depth about some of my projects as well (such as the [ByteFrost](#bytefrost---8-bit-breadboard-cpu))


##  Current Projects

* Text Adventure Engine (in Java)
  - Working in a private repository until I can create a sample adventure with it
* [ByteFrost Breadboard 8-Bit CPU](https://github.com/gilkeidar/ByteFrost)
* *Click here to add a new project*
* *Insert eventual programming language/OS/video game project*

```java
//  Create new project list using ArrayList constructor
//  (yes, Harold, we do need to explain this with a comment!)
List<Project> projectList = new ArrayList<Project>();
//  List Projects in projectList
projectList.list();
```

#  Text Adventure Engine
### Codename: **???**

### Features List
